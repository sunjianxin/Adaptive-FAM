### Introduction
This repo contains the code of practicing the proposed Adaptive-FAM.

### Execution
Run Adaptive-FAM.ipynb for the proposed adaptive encoding using functional approximation. It includes steps of micro-blocks (without ghost area) creation and their modeling into micro-models.

Run block_partition_down_sampling.ipynb for micro-blocks without ghost area.
